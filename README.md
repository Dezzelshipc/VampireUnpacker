# Unpacker (v0.17.0) - Data manager and Image generator

Run [unpacker.py](unpacker.py) with [run.bat](run.bat). It can unpack images, get language strings and split them to
different files and
languages, unpack images based on data files and make them with unified names, making (almost correct) animations
of characters and enemies.

### Getting started

Use [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/) with _**tkinter**_ and install dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Enter paths to folders where ripped assets for respective DLCs will be located with _**Change config**_.
(_OR_ enter paths where folders `...\ExportedProject\Assets` are located after ripping).

* ! ***NOTE*** that ripping will **<u>REMOVE EVERYTHING</u>** in selected folders!

Using [AssetRipper](https://github.com/AssetRipper/AssetRipper) (v1.3.8+)

* **<u>Automatically</u>** (Recommended) - Enter path to AssetRipper.exe and Steam folder for Vampire Survivors in
  config. Press _**Magic button**_ and select DLCs to rip. Your previous settings for AssetRipper will be saved.


* **Manually** - Export with **Export Unity Project** with settings:

    * Turn off "_Skip StreamingAssets Folder_",
    * "_Bundled Assets Export Mode_" set to _**Group By Asset Type**_,
    * "_Script Content Level_" set to _**Level 2**_ (**Warning**: Levels 1,2 could crash ripper for some reason (in old
      versions), but only from Level 1 you can rip I2Languages. If it crashes try level 0),
    * "_Sprite Export Format_" set to _**Texture**_,
    * Tick "_Save Settings to Disk_" checkbox and click "Save" button to save settings.
        * Main game and each DLC must be ripped separately (You have to own DLCs).
          In `...\steamapps\common\Vampire Survivors` select `VampireSurvivors_Data` or numbered folders (DLCs) to open
          in AssetRipper.

_**Enable multiprocessing**_ can increase speed in some cases in exchange for "heavily" loading CPU (and possibility of
overflowing memory for very big files).

* Currently for: _Get stage tilemap_, _Get unified audio_, _Some necessary data processing
  (Parsing data, lang, metadata, etc.)_.

### Viewing code

* Vampire Survivors uses unity with il2cpp and can't be fully decompiled. However, there are tools to view some .dll
  files. Here are some of them:
    * [Il2CppDumper](https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper)
    * [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy)
    * [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy)

## Future plans

* Keep support for new content updates and DLC.
* Rewrite Image gen to better pipeline.
